Unity used to have a package called [Standard assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2018-4-32351) and it was very useful to Indie game developers or small teams that were not willing to spend hours working on the most basic things. These are collections of assets that are widely used by most Unity customers. These are: 2D, Cameras, Characters, CrossPlatformInput, Effects, Environment, ParticleSystems, Prototyping, Utility, Vehicles.

Unfortunately this pack was discontinued after the release of Unity 2020, this repository hosts the Standard Assets which have been tweaked to work with versions higher than 2018.4

All the assets and Images contained in the source code of this repository are owned by (C) Unity Technologies, this is a modified version of the Unity Standard Assets to work with Unity further, I am in no way affiliated with Unity Technologies Inc.
